## Lab 3: Counting with 7 Segments Display
In this lab it will be demonstrated how to use GPIO to control and interface the Segment to PIC16F877A MCU.
Main aim of this lab is to print out numerical data (0 -9) using 7 Segment display

## Lab 4: Driving Stepper Motor (Unipolar)
The main obejectives of this laboratory are to operate the stepper motors and develop the necessary firmware that will make the
motor complete one full clockwise (CW) rotation, followed by a counterclockwise (CCW) rotation. Finally, a hardware circuitry will be built
to ensure proper operation of the motor.

## Lab 5: Stepper Motor Controlled Motion
The primary goals of this lab is to drive stepper motors by writing the neceessary firmware that will make the motor rotate CW
(clockwise) when one input button is pressed and rotate CCW (counterclockwise) when another button is pressed.
